SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================

This MTP requires JADE, smack and crimson libraries. The latter are already included in the distribution zip 
package, but can be updated from

SAMCK Homepage: http://www.jivesoftware.org/smack/
CRIMSON Homepage: http://xml.apache.org/crimson/

INSTALLATION
============
Assuming the JADE binary distribution has already been installed (unzipped) in your PC or server, you should have the following directory structure:

jade/
  |-...
  |- lib/
      |- jade.jar (Basic JADE runtime system)
	  
To install the XMPP MTP just unzip the distribution zip file in to the jade/ directory thus obtaining
jade/
  |-add-ons/
      |-xmpp/
         |-...
	     |-lib/
	        |-... (additional libraries needed by the XMPP MTP)
		    |-xmpp.jar (the XMPP MTP classes)
  |-...
  |- lib/
      |- jade.jar (Basic JADE runtime system)

Furthermore it is convenient to set the CLASSPATH environment variable to include both jade.jar and all jar files included in the jade/add-ons/xmpp/lib/ directory


USAGE
=======
In order to activate the XMPP MTP it is necessary to specify the following command line parameters
-mtps jade.mtp.xmpp.MessageTransportProtocol   // Tells JADE to activate the XMPP MTP
-jade_mtp_xmpp_server <jabber server>          // Tells the XMPP MTP where to find the jabber server 
-jade_mtp_xmpp_username <username>             // Credentials to access the jabber server 
-jade_mtp_xmpp_password <password>

As an Example (assuming the CLASSPATH has been properly set):

java jade.Boot -gui -mtps jade.mtp.xmpp.MessageTransportProtocol -jade_mtp_xmpp_server  jabber.org -jade_mtp_xmpp_username jade -jade_mtp_xmpp_password secret
