1. How it works ?
==================

The Inter-Platform Mobility Service has been designed and implemented
to provide platform-to-platform mobility for JADE agents, a feature
which is not available with the JADE built-in Agent Mobility Service.

This service has been built to be as transparent as possible to the
agent programmer, in the sense that, programming agents that will move
across different platforms will be as easy as moving agents between
JADE containers.

This first version of the service doesn't provide a fully featured,
optimal, secure and fault-tolerant migration system. The migration
system provided, althought simple, tries to be the basis to create a
more sophisticated service in the future. It has been built taking
into account the requirements that will surely arise from its first
usage by the community.

In this README file we will try to describe the design philosophy and
some notes about the usage, configuration and installation of this
service.

1.1 The core
-------------

The basic idea behind this service is moving agents from platforms to
other platforms carrying them inside FIPA ACL Messages. These messages
are sent between AMS agents of the involved platforms and follow the
rules imposed by some of the FIPA Interaction Protocols
(http://www.fipa.org).

The migration system provided (in this first version) is significantly
different from the one provided in intra-platform mobility. In
container-to-container mobility, although agent's user is not
conscious about that, only agent's data is sent from the origin to the
destination container. The agent's class files are transferred on demand
as they are needed by the agent. This approach is efficient in
terms of amount of data transfered over the network, but has the problem
that agent execution is highly dependent of the reliability of the network
connections and the home container. If connection to home container is
lost, agent execution could fail whether some needed class could not be
downloaded from the agent's home container.

As it can be seen from [1] there is not a perfect strategy to move
agents. It highly depends, not only in user preferences
(such as fault-tolerance, performance, ...) but also in external factors 
at migration time, like network latency, network load and so on.

The authors intention is to continue the developement of this
mobility service, providing a large set of migration
strategies and protocols. At the moment, we have only implemented a
"one-shot" migration strategy, where all data and code that the agent
will need in its execution is transfered every time agent moves. We
are concious that this is probably the worst strategy in terms of
performace, but it is probably the best in terms of fault-tolerance.
This makes mobile agent totally independent from the home
platform once it has moved, because this last can be turned off 
without impact for the moving agent.

As we previously said, we hope to provide a rich set of migration
strategies in next releases.

1.2 Jar Agents 
---------------

In the previous section we have seen which migration strategy has been
choosen to be the first one in this service, the "one-shot" migration
strategy. This kind of migration can be viewed as the simplest way of
moving an agent, but in contrast, its implementation it is far from
trivial to implement, at least in the JADE context.

Let's explain the problem graphically. Imagine that we want to move a
JADE agent from one platform to another. The home platform will be
switched off after agent's jump so it is necessary for the agent to
carry all the code that it will need during it's travel. The problem here
is, how we (the migration system) identify all the code of the agent ?
In JADE, we have all platform's code, libraries, and agent's code
mixed in the classpath so it is not easy to decide whether a library
or a class in the classpath will be used by the agent in the future.

We provide two different solutions to this problem. The simplest one
is that agent programmers can pack its agents inside a jar file. It is
supposed that the programmer has correctly packed all needed code, so
the provided jar file will be transferred together with the agent.

The second approach, more sophisticated and transparent to the
programmer, autonomously detects all needed classes and transparently
builds a jar file with them.

1.3 ACL Migration
------------------

To conclude with the introduction, we will describe the transport
mechanism used to carry agent's code and data from the origin to the
destination platform, that is, the ACL Messages.

When an agent wants to move, an ACL Message with agent's code and data
is built following an special ontology. The remote platform will use
this information to restore agent's execution and inform the origin
platform whether the agent has been correctly restored or some error has
occurred. In this second case, migration process will be aborted and
agent's execution will be restored again in the home platform.

An advantage of using ACL messages to transport the agent from one
platform to another is that we don't need to setup an extra
communication channel between platforms. Furthermore, the underlying
MTP will be the last responsible in the agent transport, so changing
the platform's MTP will automatically change agent's transport
protocol.

1.4 Future Work
----------------

The proposed mobility add-on its very simple by now. We will work to
provide more features in the next versions, some of them are:

  - Provide more migration strategies.
  - Improve the use of FIPA IPs.
  - Access Control / Security mechanisms.

Of course, all the people interested in collaborating in the
developement / design of this add-on, can contact the authors listed
below.

2. Security Considerations
===========================

It is very important to stress that security implications of using
inter-platform mobility are much more important than in intra-platform
mobility provided by default in the JADE platform. For this reason,
the authors encourage users to read carefully this section and take
into account all the risks of using migration.

Activating inter-platform mobility service implies that the machine
where the JADE platform is running, executes arbitrary code (by means
of an agent) comming from any machine reachable via network.

At the present time, does not exist any access control mechanism to
decide which incomming agents will be executed and which won't. Using
this version, we can only perform access control by means of a secure
MTP (for instance, HTTPS MTP provides some simple authentication
features that can be used for this purpose) or using network firewalls
to prevent connections from malicious platforms.

In any case, while we don't have access control for incomming mobile
agents we recomend that platforms using inter-platform mobility
services should take some security precautions:

  1. Do not use this mobility service in open environments or in
machines where sensitive information exist.
  2. Try to restrict network access to platforms by using firewalls.
  3. Try to use MTPs with some kind of authentication to prevent the
sending of malicious agent's from foreign platforms.

We hope that in next versions of this mobility service we can provide
some configurable security mechanisms, which allow to build secure
mobile-agent based applications in open environments.


3. Build & Installation
========================

In order to build this add-on the package distribution file must be
unzipped inside the JADE folder. Once unzipped, the service can be
built by using the ant tool inside the package folder, where build.xml
file is placed.

After it has been built, the command "ant lib" creates the jar file 
with all compiled class files. 


4. Usage
=========

4.1 Initialization
-------------------

In order to use the service, it is necessary to specify it from the
command line using the -services parameter:

In linux:

java jade.Boot -services
jade.core.mobility.AgentMobilityService\;jade.core.migration.InterPlatformMobilityService

In Windows:

java jade.Boot -services
jade.core.mobility.AgentMobilityService;jade.core.migration.InterPlatformMobilityService

Since IPMS version 1.1 it is possible to define through parameters the
timeout associated to each agent to do a migration. The default used
value is 5000 ms. Moreover, in order to detect trucated migration on
the destination platforms, a new timeout is associated to the agents
installed in them but not initiated. This should have a value of two
times the first timeout, then the default value is 10000 ms. It can be
redefined through a parameter too. For example, if we want to define
them to 15 seconds of timeout and 30 of timeout to initiate the agent
we should start the service as we can see in the following lines:

java jade.Boot 
-jade_core_migration_IPMS_migration_timeout 15000
-jade_core_migration_IPMS_migration_timeout_responder 30000
-services
jade.core.mobility.AgentMobilityService;jade.core.migration.InterPlatformMobilityService

If the default values are changed a message can be seen on the screen
warning about that.

4.2 Programming mobile agents
------------------------------

As we previously said, the first goal of this mobility service is to
be simple to use. Basically its usage from the programmer point of
view is very similar to the intra-platform mobility use (see Programmers 
Guide).

JADE Agents own the method doMove inherited from jade.core.Agent with
the following signature:

public void doMove(Location l)

Actually, in the JADE platform there are two implementations of the
Location interface which are the jade.core.ContainerID and
jade.core.PlatformID classes.

Programmers with experience in container-to-container mobility know
that ContainerID objects are used to wrap the name of the destination
container in intra-platform mobility.

If the Inter-platform Mobility Service has been correctly initialized
in the platform, PlatformID objects can be used in the same manner as
ContainerID, but referencing destination platforms instead of
destination containers.

If we look at the PlatformID constructor it can be seen that the
argument needed to build such an object its an AID instance.  This
must be the AID of the remote platform's AMS agent where we want to
move our agent. This AID must contains the transport address of the
remote platform. Below, we can see sample code invocating migration to
a remote platform.

Sample code:

// We build the AID corresponding to remote platform's AID 
// Specified MTP is HTTP in this case, but does not matter which is used

AID remoteAMS = new AID("ams@remotePlatform:1099/JADE", AID.ISGUID);
remoteAMS.addAddresses("http://remotePlatformaddr:7778/acc");

PlatformID destination = new PlatformID(remoteAMS); 

// We are supposing that we exectue this code from a behaviour

myAgent.doMove(destination);

Several examples can be found in the "src/jade/samples" folder.


4.3 Class Analysis and JAR Agents
----------------------------------

As we pointed at the beginning, the migration system needs to keep
track of all agent's code. In this version, we provide two ways to
achieve this goal, one which is transparent to the programmer, so
nothing special has to be done, and another that requires to do some
extra steps that we will detail below.

An easy way to isolate the code of an agent from the rest of the code
pointed in the classpath is enforcing that, all agent's that will
migrate to other platforms have all the code they need inside a jar file.

Of course, some times this requirement can be tedious for the agent
programmer who is used to compile agents, put its code in the
classpath and run them within the platform. For this reason, we have
provided a first mechanism in the migration system which automatically
generates a jarfile given an agent. This jarfile contains all agent's
code and the programmer will never notice its existence. This
mechanism has been built examining recursively the agent's main class
looking for all dependant classes, and building a jar from the final
obtained set.

In the present version, it is possible that in some special cases, the
mechanism explained above doesn't detect all the agent classes. This
could happen in agents where, for example, reflection is used to load
classes (eg Class.forName("ClassName").newInstance()). If you
experience problems, in the migration of the agent, related to class
loading it is possible that some class has not been included in the
agent's jar.

To avoid this problems we provide the possibility to manually create
the jar file containing all agent's code by ourselves. In order to do
that follow the next steps:

 1. We must create a jarfile with all our agent's class files. The jar
file name must follows a naming convention, which consists in giving
the agent's main class name as the jar file name. The name of the
class must be the qualified name, so it must contain the package it
belongs, replacing "." by "_". Following this convention, the agent
with main class org.example.MyAgent must be packed in a jar file named
org_example_MyAgent.jar.

 2. Define a folder to place all your jar packed
agents. You can specify it with the following parameter when launching 
JADE from the command line:

java jade.Boot -jade_core_management_AgentManagementService_agentspath=folder

   Of course, a config file can be used for specifying this parameter
instead of using the command line. If we ommit this step, the present
directory when the platform is started is taken for this propose.

 3. The agents like those we have described, do not need to have its
jar files in the classpath, and we load them as we do for normal
agents.
