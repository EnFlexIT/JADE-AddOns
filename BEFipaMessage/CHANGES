-- Some cleanups in the code

[03-Sep-02] Version 0.1.7

-- Support for JADE's BLE content handling
	- Codetables now support also bytearrays
-- Improved documentation

[01-Oct-01] Version 0.1.5
-- Fixed byteLengthEncoded string support; 
	- Allows BLEs inside expressions
	- Works w/ codetable
-- deprecated "public ACLEncoder(int sz, EncoderCodetable ct)"
-- depracated "public ACLInputStream (InputStream i, int sz,

-- replaced a few "System.err.println(); System.exit();" with 
   throw BEParseException :-)

-- StringBuffer in ExprParser (ACLInputStream) changed to ByteArray
   (JDK1.1.X didn't support all the functionality needed)
