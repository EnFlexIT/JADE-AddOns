The AXIS project provides the implementation of the interface.
The <a href="ext:axis-1.1">AXIS-1.1</a> is used currently.
After downloading, .jar files are placed into lib/axis-1.1 directory.
      </p>
      <p id="axis-1.1_JAVA-1.4">
The version 1.1 requieres the JAVA in version 1.4.

An XML's parser is needed for the AXIS.
The <a href="ext:xerces-2.6.2">Xerces-2.6.2</a> is one of the free available.
Xerces .jar's files are placed into lib/xerces-2_6_2 directory.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="wsdl">
      <title>WSDL Library's Installation</title>

The external Web Service client and server does requests for an access information.
The Web Service side contacts the UDDI at first.
      </p>
      <p>
The jUDDI implementation with the mysql database may be used as a UDDI registry.
These products are available free.
The <a href="ext:juddi-0.9rc3">juddi-0.9rc3</a> is tested.
The installation instructions are provided with jUDDI package.
They are more complex and there is small text document <a href="jUDDI_install.txt">jUDDI_install.txt</a> related to WSIG's requirements only.

The package comes with a .jar library precompiled.
A new recompilation may be initiate by running <code>ant jar</code> in WSIG's directory.
A documentation is able to be recompiled by typing <code>forrest</code> in doc directory.
A result is stored into doc/build directory.

<section id="wsig_configuration">
<title>WSIG's Configuration</title>
<p>
The configuration file wsig.properties is lacated in directory, where the WSIG runs typically.
The original one is placed in misc directory.
The correct values are edited in this file.
It is suitable to change lines with properties followed:
</p>

<dl>

<dt>
wsig.host.name
</dt>
<dd>
the host name of the machine, where the WSIG runs,
( <code>wsig.host.name=pc7</code> )
</dd>

<dt>
wsig.host.port
</dt>
<dd>
       a port number, where a gateway will be worked at
( <code>wsig.host.port=2222</code> )
</dd>
     
<dt>
wsig.agent_id
</dt>
<dd>
       agent ID of a gateway, the host name part must be changed according
       machine's host name.
       To leave a host name as localhost brings identification problems.
( <code>wsig.agent_id=wsigs@pc7\:1099/JADE</code> )
</dd>

<p>
Startup files require a change, when they are running outside a localhost.
Please, change host name in wsig.bat, run_TestAgentClient.bat, and run_TestAgentServer.bat.
The script's name ends with the extension .sh under the UNIX.
</p>
<p>
A level of debug messages are set in log4j.properties file.
The misc/log4j.properties.txt may be copied into running directory.
The extension .txt must be cut off.
It may be changed then.
</p>
    </section>

<section id="wsig_runs">
<title>WSIG's Running</title>
<p>
 Scripts must be run in the following order:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
      <code>run_jade_main.bat</code> 
</li>
<li>
      <code>wsig.bat</code>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
or under the UNIX:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
      <code>run_jade_main.sh</code> 
</li>
<li>
      <code>wsig.sh</code>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
It is possible to start WSIG's GUI.
Please, edit wsig.bat or wsig.sh script to append "-gui" parameter after last command in the script.
There are some examples available by menu selection.
They are provided as tuples: a registration and an invocation.
At first, the registration one must be run and then invocation is possible to perform.
The google search example requires to enter your google's ID into the wsig.properties.
</p>

</section>

<section id="wsig_examples">
<title>WSIG's Examples</title>
<p>
Examples for testing purpose are placed in misc directory.
Unix versions have extension .sh insted of .bat.
After running TestSOAPServer the TestAgentClient invokes a service.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
run_TestSOAPServer.bat
</li>
<li>
run_TestAgentClient.bat
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The second examples demonstrate an agent service, which is invoked by Web Service client.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
run_TestAgentServer.bat
</li>
<li>
run_TestSOAPClient.bat
</li>
</ol>
