      <title>A Description of the WSIG</title>
      <p>
The Web Service Integration Gateway is add-on to the JADE.
It provides bidirectional communication between an agent's platform and Web Service's side.
A Web Service may be registered into the WSIG and agents may search and invoke it then.
Agent's services may be used by Web Service's clients after they are registered into the WSIG.

      <title>To do</title>
      <p>
The gateway is not full finished yet.
There are some open parts to future developing.
      </p>
      <p>
There is a list of not implemented parts:
      </p>
<ul>
<li>
UDDI v3.0 API to communicate with a new repository,
</li>
<li>
UDDI v3.0 watching mechanism,
</li>
<li>
Jetty HTTP server inclussion to replace a proprietary HTTP server,
</li>
<li>
a categorization and an identification in DF and UDDI repositories (to help searching operations/services desired),
</li>
<li>
an ontology and a WSDL generation.
</li>
</ul>

	<p>
Some notes to WS and JADE up today (2005-08):
	</p>
<ul>
<li>
JADE and ontology representation: an ontology sharing is only through a file system's directory; there must be some way how to dentify a link between an ontology name and a jar file,
</li>
<li>
two cases to communicate in the JADE architecture: an ACL messaging and JAVA methods calls; the WSIG uses FIPA ACL's messages,
</li>
<li>
a categorization is over whole WSDL structure in the UDDI; it is hard to distinguish an operation desired from other ones in the WSDL in other way then by name,
</li>
<li>
some WS servers do not register itself into UDDI, they provides only WSDL's files; they must be registered by another program,
</li>
<li>
some WS are only described theirs interfaces in a natural language, WSDL is missing; the WSIG can not serve in this situation,
</li>
<li>
some WS do not use a SOAP format, (an example: parameters through URL); the WSIG can not serve up to now.
</li>
</ul>
