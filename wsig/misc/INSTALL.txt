
There is a brief installation guide. (updated on 2005-02-27)

1. A UDDI repository is needed.
	Access informations must be filled in a wsig.properties file according step 2.
	If a UDDI repository does not exist,
	then please install a jUDDI according a jUDDI_install.txt file.

2.1. Then set properly wsig.properties.
	A host name may be a localhost, if a running stays locally on one machine.
    
    wsig.host.name=localhost
       your host name
    
    wsig.host.port=2222
       a port number, where a gateway will be worked at
    
    wsig.agent_id=wsigs@localhost\:1099/JADE
       agent ID of a gateway, the host name part must be changed according
       machine's host name
       To leave a host name as localhost brings identification problems.
	
    uddi.wsig_businessKey=8C983E50-E09B-11D8-BE50-DA8FBF3BDC61
       a business key of your business entity in a UDDI repository
    
	uddi.userName=jna
	uddi.userPassword=somepasword
	   a user name and a password into the UDDI repository
	
	uddi.lifeCycleManagerURL=http\://localhost\:8080/jUDDI/publish
	uddi.queryManagerURL=http\://localhost\:8080/jUDDI/inquiry
	  access point into the UDDI repository
 
 2.2. Startup files require a change, when they are running outside a localhost.
	Please, change host name in wsig.bat, run_TestAgent033.bat, and run_TestAgent001.bat.
 
 2.3. A JADE libraries are required in a lib/jade directory.
 	Please, use a new JADE v3.3 or copy libraries from JADE-extension,
 	where JADE v3.2 modified is stored locally.
 
 3. Run in the following order:
      run_jade_main.bat
      wsig.bat
 
 4. The testing examples are runnable by:
      1.
      	run_TestSOAPServer.bat
      	run_TestAgent033.bat
      	
      2.
        run_TestAgent001.bat
        run_TestSOAPClient.bat
        
    Unfortunately, the search abbility of these testing examles is missed to find
    proper operation's names.
    The test examples 4.1 and 4.2 must be run in the sequence to assign good order
     of operation's names.

 Note 5:
   To see massages, please, use a tcpmon from the AXIS project.
      run_tcpmon_jUDDI.bat
    The port's numbers must be changed in the wsig.properties file properly.
    Example 5:
	uddi.lifeCycleManagerURL=http\://localhost\:1233/jUDDI/publish
	uddi.queryManagerURL=http\://localhost\:1233/jUDDI/inquiry
	  access point into the UDDI repository through a run_tcpmon_jUDDI
